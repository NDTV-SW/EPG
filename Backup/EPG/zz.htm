    <b>How do I check the status of my leave application?</b>

    <b>I need to cancel my leave. How do I do it?</b>
    <br>
    Click on "My availed Leaves" link, then click on "Cancel" link against the leave
    that you want to cancel. If the application is still pending for approval, you'll
    be able to delete this leave yourself. In case it's a sanctioned leave, your HOD
    will receive your cancellation request and this leave will get deleted from the
    system only after the HOD approves the cancellation.

    <b>How do I change the dates for my leave?</b>
    <br>
    Go to "My availed Leaves" page. If the application is still pending for approval,

    it's sanctioned, then click on "Change Date" link and your HOD will receive your
    request.
